# Automate-Mundane-Tasks-at-Work

When faced with a task at work- to "create excel sheets of data", I know its so frustating! So I wrote this code to automate that. Here I have done XML parsing using Python.

The task at hand was to list all the unique CacheItemIds for the label designs(XMLs) generated using Neodynamic. The code here lists all the CacheItemIds in the excel sheet using the xml.etree.ElementTree module.
